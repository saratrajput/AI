# NLTK parsing homework

## Purpose
Download some electronic books from Project Gutenberg. Write a program to scan
these texts for any extremely long sentences. What is the longest sentence you
can find? What syntacticconstruction(s) are responsible for such long sentences?

## Problems Encountered
- There is a problem with the longest sentence chosen by NLTK. It is also
considering punctuations like '--' at the beginning of the sentence which
makes it pick the wrong longest sentence.
